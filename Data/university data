The University of Mumbai is a public state university in Mumbai. It is one of the largest university systems in the world with over 549,000 students on its campuses and affiliated colleges.
As of 2013, the university had 711 affiliated colleges. Ratan Tata is the appointed head of the advisory council.
History

In accordance with "Wood's despatch", drafted by Sir Charles Wood in 1854, the University of Bombay was established in 1857 after the presentation of a petition from the Bombay Association
to the British colonial government in India.The University of Mumbai was modelled on similar universities in the United Kingdom, specifically the University of London. 

The first departments established were the Faculty of Arts at Elphinstone College in 1835 and the Faculty of Medicine at Grant Medical College in 1845.Both colleges existed before the university was founded
and surrendered their degree-granting privileges to the university. The first degrees awarded in 1862 were Bachelor of Arts and Licentiate in Medicine.Medical schools such as Sindh Medical School in Hyderabad,
Sindh were affiliated with the university as well.

Cornelia Sorabji, who later studied law at Somerville College becoming Oxford's first female law student and India's first female advocate, was the university's first female graduate in 1888.

Until 1904, the university only conducted examinations, awarded affiliations to colleges, developed curricula, and produced guidelines for colleges developing curricula.Teaching departments, research
disciplines, and post-graduate courses were introduced from 1904, and several additional departments were established. After India achieved independence in 1947, the functions and powers of the university were
reorganized under The Bombay University Act of 1953.The name of the university was changed from University of Bombay to University of Mumbai in 1996.

In 1949, student enrolment was 42,272 with 80 affiliated colleges. By 1975, these numbers had grown to 156,190 and 114 respectively.
Kalina Campus

Examination processes were made more efficient by the introduction of online delivery of question papers for examinations, and assessment of answer books by scanning at remote examination centres. The academic
depository of the university was started in collaboration with CDSL in 2015. The university is the first university in the country to start an academic depository.

Rajabai Clock Tower
Rajabai Clock Tower, located at the Fort campus, was built in 1878.

One of Mumbai's landmarks, the Rajabai Clock Tower, was completed in the 1870s and houses the University of Mumbai's library. Sir George Gilbert Scott modeled the Rajabai Clock Tower on the clock tower of the
Palace of Westminster in London.Local businessman Premchand Roychand contributed to the cost of construction and named the tower in memory of his mother, Rajabai. The tower is 85 m (280 ft) tall and has five
storeys. At a height of 9.1 m (30 ft) from the ground, there are eight statues representing the Indian castes. The tower clock is reported to have played 16 tunes including "Rule Britannia", "God Save the
Queen", "Home! Sweet Home!" and "A Handel Symphony".On the initiative of the then Vice-Chancellor, Rajan Welukar, the first phase of restoration of Rajabai Clock Tower started in 2013 and was completed in May
2015. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) gave a Rs 4 crore grant for this phase of the restoration project.

The Convocation Hall or Cowasji Jehangir Convocation Hall at the University of Mumbai is part of the Victorian buildings complex around the Oval Maidan in Mumbai that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was
built between 1869 and 1874, and designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, who incidentally never visited Bombay and worked from London.

It is also known as the Cowasji Jehangir Convocation Hall, after the Parsi philanthropist Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney, who funded the construction.In 2006–07, the hall was restored by a team led by the
conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah. The project was given the Award of Distinction under the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation.

Affiliated colleges
Its jurisdiction extends over 7 districts - Mumbai City district, Mumbai Suburban district, Palghar district, Raigad district, Ratnagiri district, Sindhudurg district, Thane district.
Prominent institutes

Several departments of the University of Mumbai are a part of vocational institutions and are not located on the four Mumbai campuses. These include the departments of Medicine and Medical Research located in
many prominent hospitals in Mumbai, such as the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay Hospital and G.S. Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital. The Department of Medicine at Tata Memorial Hospital is now
affiliated to the Homi Bhabha National Institute.

Institute of Chemical Technology (then known as the University Department of Chemical Technology, UDCT), was originally a department of MU, which later gained the status of a university.

Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, then known as the Victorial Jubilee Technical Institute, founded in 1887, was the first Engineering Institute of the University of Mumbai. Thadomal Shahani Engineering
College was the first Engineering college in the University of Mumbai to start courses in Computer Engineering, Information Technology, Electronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering.

Mumbai City district is a district of Maharashtra in Konkan Division, India. As a city district, it has no headquarters or subdivisions. It, along with the Mumbai Suburban District, makes up the metropolis of
Mumbai. This area is called the "Island City" or South Mumbai or Old Mumbai. It extends from Colaba in the south to Mahim and Sion in the north. The city has an area of 157 km2 (61 sq mi) and a population of
3,085,411.

The University of Mumbai (known earlier as University of Bombay) is one of the oldest and premier Universities in India. It was established in 1857 consequent to 'Wood's Education Dispatch drafted by Charles
Wood in 1854. University of Mumbai was established along with University of Madras and University of Calcutta.

'University of Bombay' was renamed as 'University of Mumbai' through notification issued by the Government of Maharashtra and published in the Government Gazette dated 4th September, 1996.

The University has always given its best to the country in general and to the city of Mumbai in particular by enthusiastically contributing to various academic, research and social initiatives.



Initially, the University concentrated its efforts on offering undergraduate courses. Later, University focus moved to establishing and enriching Post-Graduate teaching and research initiatives. This resulted
in the establishment of the University Departments beginning with the School of Sociology and Civics & Politics. The independence of the country led to the re-organization of the functions and powers of the
University with the passing of the Bombay University Act of 1953. University has also established its name in industrial collaborations and runs various professional courses.

University of Mumbai has been accredited with 'Five Star' status by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). It has two campuses of area 230 acres and 13 acres. It also has sub-centres at
Thane, Kalyan and Ratnagiri. University of Mumbai is one of the largest Universities in world in terms of number of Student enrolled very year. More than 700 Colleges and Institutions are affiliated with
University of Mumbai.

University of Mumbai has excelled in sports, cultural and out-reach activities. Many departments of University of Mumbai are recognized under various national programs, such as SAP/CAS/ DRS/DSA / COSIST /
FIST.

R. 8433 : The definitions of the key terms used in the Credit Based
Semester and Grading System introduced from the academic year 2011-12
are as under:
Program:
A Program is a set of courses that are linked together in an academically meaningful way and generally ends with the award of a Certificate or Diploma or Degree depending on the level of knowledge attained and
the total duration of study.
B.A., B.Sc. and B.Com. are Programs.
Course
A ‘course’ corresponds to the word ‘subject’ used in many universities. A course is
essentially a constituent of a ‘program’ and may be conceived of as a composite of several
learning topics taken from a certain knowledge domain, at a certain level. All the learning
topics included in a course must necessarily have academic coherence, that is, there must be a
common thread linking the various components of a course. A number of linked courses
considered together are in practice, a ‘program’.
Module and Unit:
A course which is generally an independent entity having its own separate identity, is also
often referred to as a ‘Module’ in today’s parlance, especially when we refer to a ‘modular
curricular structure’. A module may be studied in conjunction with other learning modules or
studied independently. A topic within a course is treated as a Unit.
Credit Point:
Credit Point refers to the ‘Workload’ of a learner and is an index of the number of learning
hours deemed for a certain segment of learning. These learning hours may include a variety of
learning activities like reading, reflecting, discussing, attending lectures / counseling sessions,
watching especially prepared videos, writing assignments, preparing for examinations, etc.
Credits assigned for a single course always pay attention to how many hours it would take for
a learner to complete a single course successfully. A single course should have, by and large a
course may be assigned anywhere between 2 to 8 credit points wherein 1 credit is construed
as corresponding to approximately 30 to 40 learning hours.
Credit completion and Credit accumulation:
Credit completion or Credit acquisition shall be considered to take place after the learner has
successfully cleared all the evaluation criteria with respect to a single course. Thus, a learner
who successfully completes a 4 CP (Credit Point) course may be considered to have collected
or acquired 4 credits. His level of performance above the minimum prescribed level (viz.grades / marks obtained) has no bearing on the number of credits collected or acquired. A
learner keeps on adding more and more credits as he completes successfully more and more
courses. Thus the learner ‘accumulates’ course wise credits.
Credit Bank:
The process of accumulating Credits over a period of time, leads to the idea of a ‘Credit
Bank’. Conceptually, a Credit Bank in simple terms refers to stored and dynamically updated
information regarding the number of Credits obtained by any given learner along with details
regarding the course/s for which Credit has been given, the course-level, nature, etc. In
addition, all the information regarding the number of Credits transferred to different programs
or credit exemptions given may also be stored with the individual’s history. In short, this
would involve maintaining all the Credit–related transactions of an individual. Credit
Banking, when practiced would go a long way in facilitating credit transfers and learner
mobility.
Credit Transfer:
Performance transfer
When a learner successfully completes a certain academic program, he/she is allowed to
transfer his/her past performance to another academic program having some common courses
and Performance transfer is said to have taken place.
Course exemption
Occasionally, when two academic programs offered by a single university or by more than one
university, may have some common or equivalent course-content, the learner who has already
completed one of these academic programs is allowed to skip these ‘equivalent’ courses while
registering for the new program. The Learner is ‘exempted’ from ‘relearning’ the common or
equivalent content area and from re-appearing for the concerned examinations. It is thus taken
for granted that the learner has already collected in the past the credits corresponding to the
exempted courses.
Block Transfer:
Block transfer refers to a group of courses, such as a completed certificate or diploma program
that are accepted for transfer of credit into a degree program.
Dimensions of Credit Transfer
When a learner successfully completes the courses included in an academic program at a
certain level, he/she is allowed to transfer his/her credits in some of these courses to another
same-level academic program having these courses in common. This is referred to as
‘Horizontal or Lateral Credit Transfer’.
‘Vertical Credit Transfer’, sometimes is also referred to as ‘Career Laddering’ is said to
occur when a learner’s performance in some courses within a certain academic program at a
particular level is carried over to a higher-level academic program having these or equivalent
courses in common.
Credit Transfer is conceived as operating along lateral (or horizontal) and vertical
transfers.
Types of Credit Transfer
When the process of credit transfer takes place within a university department or institution, it
may be called intra-institutional credit transfer; when the credit transfer process operates
across two or more institutions/universities, this may be viewed as inter-institutional/inter-
university credit transfer. Both inter/intra institutional/university credit transfer operate across
levels – vertical or horizontal.
Note: The Ordinances and Regulations given below are applicable to Faculty of Arts,
Commerce & Science unless and otherwise specified.
O. 5974
Duration of the B.A., B.Com. and B.Sc. programme will be of 3 years in the Semester pattern
i.e. from Sem. I to Sem. VI.
The degree will be awarded to a learner who successfully completes 120 credits of the
programme in period of 3 to 6 years from the year of enrollment to semester I.
If a learner does not earn 120 credits in 12 semesters from the year of enrolment to semester I,
he/she may at his/her option transfer his/her performance in the existing/new program after
establishing equivalence between old and new syllabus. Such a performance transfer will be
decided by the Board of Studies / Ad-hoc Board / Ad hoc Committee of the concerned
subject.
The admission to the program will be governed by the existing rules
O. 5975
The fees for transfer of credits or performance will be based on number of credits that a
learner has to complete for award of the degree.
O. 5976
The following credit transfers will be allowed
Intra-institutional/University lateral credit transfer
Intra-institutional/University vertical credit transfer
Inter-institutional/University lateral credit transfer
Inter-institutional/University vertical credit transfer

R.8434
Credits earned at one institution for one or more courses under a given program will be accepted under another program either by the same institution or another institution either through Direct Performance
Transfer or Course exemption.

will be forfeited, and the internal assessment will be calculated as out of 40 marks.
b. A learner who has appeared for the class test but fails to submit the assignment/project or remains absent for the assignment/project will be allowed to submit an additional assignment/project for 20 marks,
and the Internal Assessment will be calculated out of 40 marks.


Class test or assignment for Internal Assessment for Courses with practical:
a. A learner who is absent for the Semester End Practical Examination and the assignment/project will be declared fail in the Internal Assessment Scheme.
b. A learner who is absent for the Semester End Practical Examination and has appeared for the assignment will be awarded marks for the Journal (out of 5 marks) & Viva (out of 5 marks) component of the
Semester End Examination. Thus, he will be evaluated for 10 marks instead of 20 marks and will lose the 10 marks for the Laboratory work. However, his marks for the Semester End Practical Examination will be
taken as out of 20 (without conversion i.e. if the learner gets 4/10 marks for Journal & Viva, his/her marks for the Semester End Practical Examination will be taken as 4/20), and internal assessment will be
calculated as out of 40 marks and not 30 marks.
c. A learner who is absent for one of the two class tests and is also absent for the assignment, the learner will be allowed to appear for one additional class test OR one additional assignment as per the
selection of the student (to be given in writing to the Principal / Head of the Institution) i.e. the student will forfeit his or her 10 marks of one of the class test / assignment as the case may be and the
internal assessment will be calculated as out of 40 marks and not 30 marks.
d. A learners who is absent for one of the two class tests /assignment as the case may be the learner will be allowed to appear for one additional class test/one additional assignment and the internal assessment will be calculated as out of 40 marks.

The Additional Class Test (or viva examination) or Assignment must be conducted 15 days prior to the commencement of the Semester End Examination after following the necessary procedure and completing the
formalities.

0.6253: To pass in the individual courses of semester I to VIII examinations of first to the final year of engineering, a learner must obtain a minimum of 40% of the full marks. The minimum of 40% of the full
marks must be obtained in the Internal Assessment, End semester examination, practical, and oral examination separately in each course as applicable. Or A learner also passes in individual courses even if he
she fails in Internal Assessment but secures more than 50% in total (Internal Assessment + End Semester Examination) in that course.

0.6254: A learner who fails in an examination but secures a minimum of 40% of the marks assigned to the Internal Assessment, End semester examination, practical, and/or oral examination in a course will, at
his/her option, be exempted from reappearing in the Internal Assessment, End semester examination, practical, and/or oral examination in that course. The marks secured by such a learner in the Internal
Assessment, End semester examination, practical, and/or oral examination will be carried forward to the subsequent examination at which he/she reappears.


0.6255: Credit (C) for a course is dependent on the number of hours of instruction per week in that course and is obtained by using a multiplier of one (1) for lecture and tutorial hours, and a multiplier of
half (1/2) for laboratory hours. The minimum credit required for the award of a B.E. degree is 180.

0.6256: Rating of learner’s performance in a theory course should be done by using various modes of assessment, which mainly include Internal Assessment and End Semester Examination. The relative weightage for
Internal Assessment is typically 20 per cent. This will consist of two class tests. The relative weightage for the end semester examination is 80%, and will be held as per the university schedule. The end
semester examination is mandatory.

0.6257: A learner is awarded a letter grade in every course, based on the combined performance in all assessments in a particular semester as per the scheme of instructions and examinations of the respective
program. These letter grades not only indicate a qualitative assessment of the learner’s performance but also carry a quantitative (numeric) equivalent called the Grade Point. The letter grades and their
equivalent grade points applicable for undergraduate programs are as below:

Percentage of Marks Obtained | Letter Grade | Grade Points | Performance
------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------
80.00 and above               | O            | 10           | Outstanding
75.00 – 79.99                 | A            | 9            | Excellent
70.00 – 74.99                 | B            | 8            | Very Good
60.00 – 69.99                 | C            | 7            | Good
50.00 – 59.99                 | D            | 6            | Fair
45.00 – 49.99                 | E            | 5            | Average
40.00 – 44.99                 | P            | 4            | Pass
Less than 40.00               | F            | 0            | Fail

0.6258: The grade for theory courses can be awarded only after the successful completion of both Internal Assessment and End Semester Examination of the respective course as per the scheme of instructions and
examinations of the respective program.



0.6259:
If a learner remains absent in any form of evaluation/examination, the letter grade allocated to them should be "AB," and the corresponding grade point is zero. The learner should reappear for the said evaluation/examination in due course.

0.6260:
The performance of a learner in a semester is indicated by a number called Semester Grade Performance Index (SGPI). The SGPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses by the
learner during the semester. For example, if a learner passes five courses (Theory/labs./Projects/Seminar, etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5, and learners grade points in these courses
are G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5 respectively, then the learner's SGPI is equal to:
SGPI=(C1×G1+C2×G2+C3×G3+C4×G4+C5×G5)(C1+C2+C3+C4+C5)SGPI=(C1+C2+C3+C4+C5)(C1×G1+C2×G2+C3×G3+C4×G4+C5×G5)​
The SGPI is calculated to two decimal places. The SGPI for any semester will take into consideration the "F or AB" grade awarded in that semester. For example, if a learner has failed in course 4, the SGPI
will then be computed as:

0.6261:
A learner's up-to-date assessment of the overall performance from the time they entered the program is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Grade Performance Index (CGPI), in a manner similar
to the calculation of SGPI. The CGPI considers all the courses mentioned in the scheme of instructions and examinations, towards the minimum requirement of the degree the learner has enrolled for. The CGPI is
calculated at the end of every semester up to two decimal places and is indicated in semester grade report cards.
CGPI=∑i=1n(Ci×Gi)∑i=1nCiCGPI=∑i=1n​Ci​∑i=1n​(Ci​×Gi​)​
The CGPI will reflect the failed status in case of "F" grade(s), until the course(s) is/are passed. When the course(s) is/are passed by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent examination(s), the CGPI will only
reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier. Example: Up to semester "r," a learner has registered for n courses, among which s/he has "F" grade in the ith course. The semester grade report at
the end of semester r, therefore, will contain a CGPI calculated as:

Even if a learner has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the
numerator as well as the denominator. At the end of semester r+1 s/he has appeared for
examination for k number of courses including the ith backlog course and has cleared all the
courses including the backlog course, the CGPI at the end of this semester is calculated as:
\[ CGPI_{r+1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} (C_i \times G_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} C_i} \]
There will also be a final CGPI calculated which considers all the credits earned by the learner
specified for a particular programme.

0.6262:
A learner who has passed the Bachelor of Engineering degree examination of the university and
who wishes to improve their CGPI be permitted to appear again for the same examination with the
same courses. The learner may appear Semester VII and VIII together or separately but all
courses of semester VII together and all courses of semester VIII together without being required
to keep any term again. This provision shall be applicable subsequent to the first passing of the
degree examination for not more than three consecutive examinations conducted by the
University. Marks obtained by the candidate in term-work, internal assessment, practical and/or
oral examination, seminar and project of semester VII and semester VIII shall be carried forward
for not more than three consecutive examinations.

0.6263:
A learner who has passed the Bachelor of Engineering degree examination of the
university and wishes to improve CGPI at any point in time be permitted to appear again for the
existing examination with the available courses at that point in time. The learner may appear
Semester VII and VIII together or separately but all courses of semester VII together and all
courses of semester VIII together without being required to keep any term again. Marks obtained
by the candidate in term-work, internal assessment, practical and/or oral examination, seminar
and project of semester VII and semester VIII whichever applicable shall be carried forward.
