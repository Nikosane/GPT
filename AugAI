Bad actors, including authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals, and rogue states, find utility in the plethora of tools provided by artificial intelligence. One alarming manifestation is the lethal autonomous weapon, capable of identifying, selecting, and engaging human targets sans human intervention. The accessibility of AI tools facilitates the development of inexpensive autonomous weapons by malevolent entities, potentially culminating in weapons of mass destruction if produced on a large scale. Even in conventional warfare scenarios, their unreliability in target selection poses the risk of innocent casualties. Despite calls for a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, discord persists among nations, with some like China supporting the ban while others like the United States dissent. The proliferation of AI tools also empowers authoritarian regimes in various oppressive tactics. Widespread surveillance facilitated by face and voice recognition aids in citizen control, with machine learning enabling the identification and suppression of perceived threats to the state. Recommendation systems efficiently disseminate propaganda and misinformation, while technologies like deepfakes and generative AI further blur the lines between truth and fiction. Moreover, advanced AI enhances centralized decision-making in authoritarian systems, rivaling the efficiency of liberal and decentralized models such as markets. The digital landscape witnesses a lowering of barriers to entry in warfare and espionage, with AI-driven advancements making these endeavors more accessible and cost-effective. Notably, AI facial recognition systems have already been deployed for mass surveillance in China, showcasing the rapid integration of such technologies into oppressive regimes. Furthermore, the scope of AI's potential assistance to bad actors extends beyond current understanding, with machine-learning AI capable of designing toxic molecules en masse within mere hours. However, the development and training of AI systems necessitate significant computing power, a resource predominantly accessible to industry giants. Thus, smaller entities like startups often resort to purchasing access to data centers from tech behemoths like Google and Microsoft to engage in AI development endeavors.
