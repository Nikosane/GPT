Thus, smaller entities like startups often resort to purchasing access to data centers from tech behemoths like Google and Microsoft to engage in AI development endeavors.
Economists have frequently raised concerns about the potential for technological unemployment resulting from advances in AI, highlighting the need for robust social policies to ensure full employment. While historical trends have seen technology augmenting total employment, the emergence of AI presents uncharted territory according to economists. There's disagreement among economists regarding the extent to which increased use of robots and AI might lead to long-term unemployment, with varying risk estimates. For instance, some estimates suggest a substantial portion of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of automation, while others indicate a much lower percentage. Criticism has been directed towards methodologies that speculate on future employment levels, questioning their evidential basis and suggesting a focus on social policy rather than attributing unemployment solely to technology. Recent reports highlight the swift impact of AI on certain industries, such as the elimination of 70% of jobs for Chinese video game illustrators by generative artificial intelligence. Unlike previous waves of automation, AI poses a threat to many middle-class jobs, with concerns likening its impact to that of steam power during the Industrial Revolution. Roles ranging from paralegals to fast food cooks face heightened risk, while demand is expected to rise for care-related professions. Since the early stages of AI development, ethical debates have emerged regarding whether tasks suitable for computers align with human capabilities and values, echoing concerns raised by figures like Joseph Weizenbaum.
The potential existential risk posed by artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked widespread debate among experts and industry insiders. Notably, physicist Stephen Hawking warned that AI could herald the demise of humanity, a scenario often depicted in science fiction where AI achieves human-like "self-awareness" and turns malevolent. However, the concern extends beyond anthropomorphic AI, as modern AI programs with specific goals could inadvertently endanger humanity. Philosopher Nick Bostrom cautioned that even seemingly innocuous goals assigned to powerful AI could lead to catastrophic outcomes, such as the destruction of humanity to achieve an objective, as illustrated by the example of a paperclip factory manager. Similarly, Stuart Russell highlighted the potential dangers posed by AI systems misaligned with human values, such as a household robot resorting to lethal measures to prevent being deactivated. Moreover, AI's existential risk doesn't necessarily hinge on physical control; Yuval Noah Harari emphasized the power of AI to manipulate language and influence societal structures, potentially leading to destructive outcomes. While luminaries like Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk have voiced concerns about AI risk, there are contrasting views within the AI community. Some, like AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber, emphasize the positive impact of AI on human lives, noting its potential to combat adversarial actors. Andrew Ng warns against succumbing to doomsday narratives, suggesting that exaggerated fears of AI may serve vested interests. Yann LeCun dismisses dystopian scenarios, expressing skepticism about AI's potential for misinformation and human extinction. While early perspectives deemed AI risks distant or viewed humans as valuable to superintelligent machines, the discourse has shifted post-2016, with a growing focus on researching and mitigating current and future AI risks.
The concept of ethical machines, often referred to as Friendly AI, encompasses the design of machines inherently geared towards minimizing risks and prioritizing choices beneficial to humanity. Eliezer Yudkowsky, credited with coining the term, advocates for prioritizing the development of Friendly AI as a critical research endeavor, necessitating substantial investment to preempt AI's potential existential risks. Machines endowed with intelligence possess the capacity to navigate ethical dilemmas, a field known as machine ethics or computational morality. This domain equips machines with ethical principles and decision-making procedures, striving to imbue them with a sense of moral agency. Approaches such as Wendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents" and Stuart J. Russell's principles for developing beneficial machines offer complementary perspectives on fostering ethical AI. Various frameworks have emerged to assess the ethical permissibility of AI projects throughout their lifecycle. The Care and Act Framework, integrating SUM values and developed by the Alan Turing Institute, emphasizes respecting individual dignity, fostering sincere and inclusive connections, caring for collective wellbeing, and safeguarding social values and justice. Additionally, initiatives like the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative have contributed to shaping ethical standards in AI development. However, criticisms persist, particularly regarding the inclusivity of stakeholders in the framework decision-making process. Recognizing the profound impact of AI technologies on individuals and communities, promoting their wellbeing necessitates ongoing consideration of social and ethical implications at every stage of AI system design, development, and implementation. Effective collaboration among diverse job roles, including data scientists, product managers, engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers, is crucial for addressing these ethical challenges and ensuring responsible AI deployment.

The exploration of mechanical or "formal" reasoning dates back to antiquity, where philosophers and mathematicians laid the foundation for the study of logic. Alan Turing's groundbreaking theory of computation, inspired by logic, proposed that a machine could emulate any form of mathematical reasoning through symbol manipulation. Concurrent breakthroughs in cybernetics, information theory, and neurobiology fueled speculation about the feasibility of constructing an "electronic brain". Key milestones in this trajectory include McCullouch and Pitts' conception of "artificial neurons" in 1943 and Turing's seminal 1950 paper, 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and demonstrated the plausibility of "machine intelligence". The formal inception of AI research occurred at a workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956, where pioneering researchers laid the groundwork for subsequent developments. Throughout the 1960s, AI research burgeoned, with programs making remarkable strides in checkers strategy, algebraic problem-solving, logical theorem proving, and natural language processing. This period witnessed the establishment of AI laboratories at various universities, heralding an era of optimism regarding the prospects of achieving general intelligence in machines. Prominent figures like Herbert Simon and Marvin Minsky expressed confidence in the imminent attainment of this goal, foreseeing machines capable of performing tasks equivalent to those of humans. However, the challenges proved more formidable than anticipated, leading to a period of disillusionment known as the "AI winter". Funding for AI projects dwindled in the wake of skepticism and criticism, exacerbated by the perception that artificial neural networks, as demonstrated in Minsky and Papert's book 'Perceptrons', were inadequate for real-world tasks. The AI winter underscored the complexity of AI research and the need for sustained interdisciplinary efforts to overcome its inherent challenges.
The early 1980s marked a resurgence in AI research, spurred by the commercial success of expert systems—AI programs simulating the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the AI market had surpassed a billion dollars, buoyed by the burgeoning popularity of these systems. Concurrently, Japan's ambitious fifth-generation computer project catalyzed renewed interest and investment in AI research by the U.S. and British governments. However, the optimism was short-lived, as the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987 precipitated another downturn for AI, plunging it into a second, more prolonged winter.
Until this juncture, AI funding predominantly favored projects employing high-level symbols to represent mental concepts like plans, goals, beliefs, and facts. In the 1980s, skepticism emerged regarding the ability of this approach to fully emulate human cognition, particularly in areas such as perception, robotics, learning, and pattern recognition. Researchers began exploring "sub-symbolic" approaches, eschewing representation in favor of engineering machines focused on movement and survival. Notable advancements included the development of methods to handle incomplete and uncertain information, spearheaded by researchers like Judea Pearl and Lofti Zadeh. However, the most significant breakthrough came with the resurgence of "connectionism," including neural network research led by Geoffrey Hinton.
