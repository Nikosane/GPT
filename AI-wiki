Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.Such machines may be called AIs.

AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."

Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.The field went through multiple cycles of optimism,followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.

The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.

To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.

Goals
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.

Reasoning and problem solving
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.
Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. 

Knowledge representation
Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,scene interpretation,clinical decision support,knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),and other areas.

A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.Knowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;situations, events, states and time;causes and effects;knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.

Planning and decision making
An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.In automated decision making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.
In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.
In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be.
A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.
Game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.

Learning
Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.It has been a part of AI from the beginning.
There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).
In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.
Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.

Natural language processing
Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.
Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning, and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.
Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.

Perception
Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.
The field includes speech recognition,image classification,facial recognition, object recognition,and robotic perception. 

Social intelligence
Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.
However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.

General intelligence
A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.

Techniques
AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.
Search and optimization
AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.

State space search
State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.
Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes."Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.
Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.

Local search
Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.
Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.
Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.
Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).

Logic
Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as "and", "or", "not" and "implies") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as "Every X is a Y" and "There are some Xs that are Ys").
Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.
Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.
Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.
Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.
Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.

Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning
Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.
Bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).
Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).

Classifiers and statistical learning methods
The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.
There are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the "most widely used learner" at Google, due in part to its scalability. Neural networks are also used as classifiers.

Artificial neural networks
An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.
Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.
In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons, deep learning uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are "close" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an "edge" before the network can identify an object.

Deep learning
Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.
Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.

GPT
Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences (natural language processing). Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet. The pre-training consists in predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pre-training, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world, and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are still prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text.
Current models and services include: Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound and text.

Specialized hardware and software
In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. Historically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, Python and others, had been used.

Applications
AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok). 

Health and medicine
The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.
For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen our understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023, it was reported that AI guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.

Games
Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then in 2017 it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021 an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.

Military
Various countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.
In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.

Generative AI
In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. In March 2023, 58% of US adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.

Industry-specific tasks
There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.
In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.
Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.

Risks and harm
Privacy and copyright
Machine-learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.
Technology companies collect a wide range of data from their users, including online activity, geolocation data, video and audio. For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.
AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'."
Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Website owners who do not wish to have their copyrighted content AI-indexed or 'scraped' can add code to their site if they do not want their website to be indexed by a search engine, which is currently available through certain services such as OpenAI. Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work". In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.
Bad actors, including authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals, and rogue states, find utility in the plethora of tools provided by artificial intelligence. One alarming manifestation is the lethal autonomous weapon, capable of identifying, selecting, and engaging human targets sans human intervention. The accessibility of AI tools facilitates the development of inexpensive autonomous weapons by malevolent entities, potentially culminating in weapons of mass destruction if produced on a large scale. Even in conventional warfare scenarios, their unreliability in target selection poses the risk of innocent casualties. Despite calls for a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, discord persists among nations, with some like China supporting the ban while others like the United States dissent. The proliferation of AI tools also empowers authoritarian regimes in various oppressive tactics. Widespread surveillance facilitated by face and voice recognition aids in citizen control, with machine learning enabling the identification and suppression of perceived threats to the state. Recommendation systems efficiently disseminate propaganda and misinformation, while technologies like deepfakes and generative AI further blur the lines between truth and fiction. Moreover, advanced AI enhances centralized decision-making in authoritarian systems, rivaling the efficiency of liberal and decentralized models such as markets. The digital landscape witnesses a lowering of barriers to entry in warfare and espionage, with AI-driven advancements making these endeavors more accessible and cost-effective. Notably, AI facial recognition systems have already been deployed for mass surveillance in China, showcasing the rapid integration of such technologies into oppressive regimes. Furthermore, the scope of AI's potential assistance to bad actors extends beyond current understanding, with machine-learning AI capable of designing toxic molecules en masse within mere hours. However, the development and training of AI systems necessitate significant computing power, a resource predominantly accessible to industry giants. Thus, smaller entities like startups often resort to purchasing access to data centers from tech behemoths like Google and Microsoft to engage in AI development endeavors.
Economists have frequently raised concerns about the potential for technological unemployment resulting from advances in AI, highlighting the need for robust social policies to ensure full employment. While historical trends have seen technology augmenting total employment, the emergence of AI presents uncharted territory according to economists. There's disagreement among economists regarding the extent to which increased use of robots and AI might lead to long-term unemployment, with varying risk estimates. For instance, some estimates suggest a substantial portion of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of automation, while others indicate a much lower percentage. Criticism has been directed towards methodologies that speculate on future employment levels, questioning their evidential basis and suggesting a focus on social policy rather than attributing unemployment solely to technology. Recent reports highlight the swift impact of AI on certain industries, such as the elimination of 70% of jobs for Chinese video game illustrators by generative artificial intelligence. Unlike previous waves of automation, AI poses a threat to many middle-class jobs, with concerns likening its impact to that of steam power during the Industrial Revolution. Roles ranging from paralegals to fast food cooks face heightened risk, while demand is expected to rise for care-related professions. Since the early stages of AI development, ethical debates have emerged regarding whether tasks suitable for computers align with human capabilities and values, echoing concerns raised by figures like Joseph Weizenbaum.
The potential existential risk posed by artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked widespread debate among experts and industry insiders. Notably, physicist Stephen Hawking warned that AI could herald the demise of humanity, a scenario often depicted in science fiction where AI achieves human-like "self-awareness" and turns malevolent. However, the concern extends beyond anthropomorphic AI, as modern AI programs with specific goals could inadvertently endanger humanity. Philosopher Nick Bostrom cautioned that even seemingly innocuous goals assigned to powerful AI could lead to catastrophic outcomes, such as the destruction of humanity to achieve an objective, as illustrated by the example of a paperclip factory manager. Similarly, Stuart Russell highlighted the potential dangers posed by AI systems misaligned with human values, such as a household robot resorting to lethal measures to prevent being deactivated. Moreover, AI's existential risk doesn't necessarily hinge on physical control; Yuval Noah Harari emphasized the power of AI to manipulate language and influence societal structures, potentially leading to destructive outcomes. While luminaries like Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk have voiced concerns about AI risk, there are contrasting views within the AI community. Some, like AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber, emphasize the positive impact of AI on human lives, noting its potential to combat adversarial actors. Andrew Ng warns against succumbing to doomsday narratives, suggesting that exaggerated fears of AI may serve vested interests. Yann LeCun dismisses dystopian scenarios, expressing skepticism about AI's potential for misinformation and human extinction. While early perspectives deemed AI risks distant or viewed humans as valuable to superintelligent machines, the discourse has shifted post-2016, with a growing focus on researching and mitigating current and future AI risks.
The concept of ethical machines, often referred to as Friendly AI, encompasses the design of machines inherently geared towards minimizing risks and prioritizing choices beneficial to humanity. Eliezer Yudkowsky, credited with coining the term, advocates for prioritizing the development of Friendly AI as a critical research endeavor, necessitating substantial investment to preempt AI's potential existential risks. Machines endowed with intelligence possess the capacity to navigate ethical dilemmas, a field known as machine ethics or computational morality. This domain equips machines with ethical principles and decision-making procedures, striving to imbue them with a sense of moral agency. Approaches such as Wendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents" and Stuart J. Russell's principles for developing beneficial machines offer complementary perspectives on fostering ethical AI. Various frameworks have emerged to assess the ethical permissibility of AI projects throughout their lifecycle. The Care and Act Framework, integrating SUM values and developed by the Alan Turing Institute, emphasizes respecting individual dignity, fostering sincere and inclusive connections, caring for collective wellbeing, and safeguarding social values and justice. Additionally, initiatives like the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative have contributed to shaping ethical standards in AI development. However, criticisms persist, particularly regarding the inclusivity of stakeholders in the framework decision-making process. Recognizing the profound impact of AI technologies on individuals and communities, promoting their wellbeing necessitates ongoing consideration of social and ethical implications at every stage of AI system design, development, and implementation. Effective collaboration among diverse job roles, including data scientists, product managers, engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers, is crucial for addressing these ethical challenges and ensuring responsible AI deployment.
The regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of public sector policies and laws aimed at both promoting and controlling AI technologies, closely intertwined with the broader regulation of algorithms. This regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving, with jurisdictions worldwide grappling with emerging issues related to AI governance. According to the AI Index at Stanford, there has been a significant surge in the annual number of AI-related laws passed across surveyed countries, reflecting heightened regulatory attention. Over the past few years, numerous countries have adopted dedicated strategies for AI, with most EU member states, along with countries like Canada, China, India, Japan, and others, releasing national AI strategies. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, launched in 2020, underscores the importance of developing AI in alignment with human rights and democratic values to foster public trust. Notable figures such as Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher have advocated for government commissions to regulate AI, highlighting the urgency of governance in the face of rapid technological advancement. In response to the growing concerns surrounding AI safety, OpenAI leaders issued governance recommendations in 2023, anticipating the rise of superintelligent AI within the decade. Concurrently, the United Nations established an advisory body to provide guidance on AI governance, comprising representatives from technology firms, governments, and academia. Public attitudes towards AI vary widely across countries, as evidenced by surveys indicating differing perceptions of AI benefits and risks. Calls for government regulation of AI are also influenced by public opinion, with polls showing varying degrees of support for regulatory intervention. The inaugural global AI Safety Summit convened in 2023, bringing together representatives from 28 countries to discuss the immediate and long-term risks posed by AI and explore potential regulatory frameworks, both mandatory and voluntary. The summit underscored the importance of international cooperation in managing the challenges and risks associated with artificial intelligence.
The exploration of mechanical or "formal" reasoning dates back to antiquity, where philosophers and mathematicians laid the foundation for the study of logic. Alan Turing's groundbreaking theory of computation, inspired by logic, proposed that a machine could emulate any form of mathematical reasoning through symbol manipulation. Concurrent breakthroughs in cybernetics, information theory, and neurobiology fueled speculation about the feasibility of constructing an "electronic brain". Key milestones in this trajectory include McCullouch and Pitts' conception of "artificial neurons" in 1943 and Turing's seminal 1950 paper, 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and demonstrated the plausibility of "machine intelligence". The formal inception of AI research occurred at a workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956, where pioneering researchers laid the groundwork for subsequent developments. Throughout the 1960s, AI research burgeoned, with programs making remarkable strides in checkers strategy, algebraic problem-solving, logical theorem proving, and natural language processing. This period witnessed the establishment of AI laboratories at various universities, heralding an era of optimism regarding the prospects of achieving general intelligence in machines. Prominent figures like Herbert Simon and Marvin Minsky expressed confidence in the imminent attainment of this goal, foreseeing machines capable of performing tasks equivalent to those of humans. However, the challenges proved more formidable than anticipated, leading to a period of disillusionment known as the "AI winter". Funding for AI projects dwindled in the wake of skepticism and criticism, exacerbated by the perception that artificial neural networks, as demonstrated in Minsky and Papert's book 'Perceptrons', were inadequate for real-world tasks. The AI winter underscored the complexity of AI research and the need for sustained interdisciplinary efforts to overcome its inherent challenges.
The early 1980s marked a resurgence in AI research, spurred by the commercial success of expert systems—AI programs simulating the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the AI market had surpassed a billion dollars, buoyed by the burgeoning popularity of these systems. Concurrently, Japan's ambitious fifth-generation computer project catalyzed renewed interest and investment in AI research by the U.S. and British governments. However, the optimism was short-lived, as the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987 precipitated another downturn for AI, plunging it into a second, more prolonged winter.
Until this juncture, AI funding predominantly favored projects employing high-level symbols to represent mental concepts like plans, goals, beliefs, and facts. In the 1980s, skepticism emerged regarding the ability of this approach to fully emulate human cognition, particularly in areas such as perception, robotics, learning, and pattern recognition. Researchers began exploring "sub-symbolic" approaches, eschewing representation in favor of engineering machines focused on movement and survival. Notable advancements included the development of methods to handle incomplete and uncertain information, spearheaded by researchers like Judea Pearl and Lofti Zadeh. However, the most significant breakthrough came with the resurgence of "connectionism," including neural network research led by Geoffrey Hinton. Yann LeCun's successful demonstration in 1990 that convolutional neural networks could recognize handwritten digits marked a watershed moment, heralding a new era of neural network applications.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI experienced a gradual rehabilitation, leveraging formal mathematical methods and specialized problem-solving approaches. This narrower focus yielded tangible results, fostering collaboration with diverse fields such as statistics, economics, and mathematics. Although AI solutions were widely deployed by 2000, the term "artificial intelligence" fell out of favor during the 1990s. Concerns arose among some academic circles that AI had diverged from its original ambition of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. In response, the subfield of artificial general intelligence (AGI) emerged around 2002, attracting substantial funding and establishing well-endowed institutions by the 2010s.
In 2012, deep learning emerged as a dominant force in AI, revolutionizing industry benchmarks and swiftly permeating the field. Its ascendancy prompted the abandonment of alternative methods for many specific tasks, marking a paradigm shift in AI research and application. Deep learning's success was underpinned by concurrent advancements in hardware, including faster computers, graphics processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing infrastructure, enabling unprecedented computational capabilities. Equally pivotal was the accessibility of vast amounts of data, facilitated by curated datasets like ImageNet, which provided fertile ground for training deep learning models. This convergence of hardware prowess and data abundance fueled a surge of interest and investment in AI, catalyzing a significant increase in machine learning research output.
In 2016, mounting concerns regarding fairness and ethical implications of technology surfaced prominently within the machine learning community. The proliferation of publications addressing these issues, coupled with increased funding availability, spurred a reorientation of research priorities for many scholars. The alignment problem, pertaining to the ethical and societal ramifications of AI deployment, emerged as a focal point of academic inquiry.
The late teens and early 2020s witnessed the rise of AGI companies delivering groundbreaking programs that captured global attention. DeepMind's AlphaGo, which defeated the world champion Go player in 2015, showcased the potential of AI to master complex tasks through self-learning. OpenAI's GPT-3, released in 2020, demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating human-like text, further fueling excitement and investment in AI. This surge in AI innovation spurred an aggressive boom, with major corporations pouring billions into AI research. In the United States alone, annual investments in "AI" reached approximately $50 billion by 2022, reflecting the staggering growth and potential of the industry. The burgeoning demand for AI expertise was evidenced by a significant portion of new Computer Science PhD graduates specializing in "AI" and a vast number of job openings in the field.
The philosophical inquiry into artificial intelligence (AI) delves into fundamental questions surrounding the nature and definition of intelligence in machines. Alan Turing's seminal query in 1950, "Can machines think?", laid the groundwork for subsequent debates in the field. Turing proposed shifting the focus from whether machines possess human-like cognition to assessing their capacity for intelligent behavior. His iconic Turing test, gauging a machine's ability to engage in human-like conversation, became a cornerstone in AI discourse, emphasizing observable behavior over internal mechanisms.
Russell and Norvig echo Turing's emphasis on external behavior as the arbiter of intelligence, advocating for a definition rooted in observable actions rather than internal structures. However, they critique the anthropocentric nature of the Turing test, likening it to demanding airplanes to mimic birds. John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, among AI pioneers, offer alternative definitions of intelligence, framing it as the computational prowess to achieve goals or solve complex problems. Similarly, leading AI textbooks characterize intelligence as the ability of agents to perceive their environment and undertake actions to maximize goal attainment.
The philosophical exploration of AI's essence transcends mere technical considerations, engaging with profound questions about cognition, consciousness, and the nature of intelligence itself. As AI continues to evolve, so too will the philosophical discourse surrounding its definition and implications for humanity.
AI research has traversed diverse avenues over its history, lacking a singular unified theory or paradigm to guide its trajectory. However, the ascendancy of statistical machine learning in the 2010s emerged as a watershed moment, overshadowing alternative approaches and becoming synonymous with "artificial intelligence" in many contexts, particularly within the business sphere. This dominance is underscored by the widespread adoption of neural networks, epitomizing a largely sub-symbolic, soft, and narrow approach to AI.
Statistical machine learning, propelled by the advent of deep learning and bolstered by vast amounts of data, has yielded remarkable achievements across various domains, from natural language processing to image recognition. Its success has reshaped the landscape of AI research and applications, fostering a paradigm shift towards data-driven methodologies.
Critics, however, contend that the prevailing emphasis on statistical machine learning may obscure broader philosophical questions about intelligence and cognition. The sub-symbolic nature of this approach, characterized by the manipulation of raw data rather than explicit symbolic representation, raises concerns about interpretability and understanding. Moreover, the narrow focus on specific tasks may overlook the broader goal of achieving human-like intelligence.
As AI continues to evolve, it is imperative for researchers to reflect on the limitations and implications of current approaches. While statistical machine learning has yielded unprecedented advancements, it is essential to remain cognizant of the broader philosophical questions that underpin AI research. Future generations of AI researchers may need to revisit and reassess these questions to chart a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of artificial intelligence.
Symbolic AI, also known as "GOFAI" (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), aimed to emulate the conscious reasoning processes humans employ in tasks like puzzle-solving, legal reasoning, and mathematics. Championed by Newell and Simon in the 1960s through the physical symbol systems hypothesis, Symbolic AI demonstrated considerable success in tasks requiring high-level cognitive abilities, such as algebra or IQ tests.
However, Symbolic AI faced significant limitations in tasks that humans perform effortlessly, such as learning, object recognition, and common-sense reasoning. Moravec's paradox underscored this disparity, revealing that while AI excelled at high-level intellectual tasks, it struggled with low-level instinctual tasks. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had posited in the 1960s that human expertise relies more on unconscious instinct than conscious symbol manipulation, emphasizing the importance of intuitive understanding over explicit symbolic knowledge. Over time, AI research increasingly aligned with Dreyfus's perspective, recognizing the inherent limitations of purely symbolic approaches.
Despite advancements in sub-symbolic reasoning, such as machine learning, challenges persist, including issues like algorithmic bias and the lack of explainability in AI decision-making processes. Critics like Noam Chomsky advocate for continued exploration of symbolic AI, contending that it remains essential for achieving general intelligence. Symbolic AI offers the potential for explainable AI, allowing humans to comprehend the rationale behind AI decisions. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence seeks to integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches, aiming to harness the strengths of both paradigms for more robust and interpretable AI systems. 
In the realm of AI, two contrasting perspectives have emerged: neats and scruffies. Neats advocate for the use of simple, elegant principles—such as logic, optimization, or neural networks—to describe intelligent behavior. Scruffies, on the other hand, believe that achieving intelligent behavior necessitates solving a multitude of unrelated problems. Neats defend their approaches with theoretical rigor, while scruffies rely primarily on incremental testing to determine efficacy. While actively debated in the 1970s and 1980s, this dichotomy eventually lost relevance as modern AI incorporates elements of both perspectives.
Another dichotomy in AI is between soft and hard computing. In many crucial problems, finding a provably correct or optimal solution proves to be intractable. Soft computing encompasses a range of techniques—such as genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and neural networks—that tolerate imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. Introduced in the late 1980s, soft computing has become increasingly prevalent in AI, with neural networks being particularly prominent. The success of soft computing techniques underscores their adaptability and effectiveness in addressing complex real-world problems.
In the realm of AI research, there exists a dichotomy between narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI focuses on solving specific problems with specific solutions, aiming to address immediate challenges effectively. In contrast, general AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), aspires to develop machines with the capacity for generalized intelligence and reasoning akin to human cognition. However, the pursuit of AGI poses significant challenges, as defining and measuring general intelligence proves elusive, while narrow AI has demonstrated tangible successes in addressing specific tasks.
Some AI researchers advocate for the direct pursuit of AGI and superintelligence, viewing it as the ultimate goal of the field. Others advocate for an indirect approach, wherein solving specific problems with narrow AI may eventually pave the way towards achieving AGI goals. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence exclusively studies this area, exploring methods and techniques to develop machines with broader cognitive abilities.
The question of machine consciousness, sentience, and mind delves into the philosophical realm, pondering whether machines can possess internal experiences akin to human consciousness. Mainstream AI research largely regards this question as irrelevant to its goals of problem-solving and intelligence development. Russell and Norvig underscore this sentiment, stating that replicating human consciousness is beyond the scope of current AI capabilities. Nonetheless, this question remains central to the philosophy of mind and is a recurring theme in AI fiction, reflecting broader societal reflections on the nature of consciousness and intelligence.
David Chalmers delineated two fundamental challenges in comprehending the mind: the "hard" problem and the "easy" problem of consciousness. The easy problem pertains to understanding the mechanistic processes of the brain, such as signal processing, planning, and behavioral control. In contrast, the hard problem revolves around elucidating the subjective experience of consciousness—why and how it feels like something to be conscious.
The hard problem poses a profound philosophical puzzle: explaining the qualitative nature of conscious experience, known as qualia, and understanding why such experiences exist at all. This inquiry delves into the essence of subjective perception and the nature of consciousness itself. For instance, while we can easily grasp how a color-blind individual might learn to identify objects based on their appearance, comprehending their subjective experience of color remains elusive.
Daniel Dennett's theory of consciousness illusionism posits that the subjective experience of consciousness is illusory—a byproduct of mechanistic brain processes rather than a fundamental aspect of reality. According to this view, there is no inherent "hard problem" of consciousness, as subjective experience is merely a construct of cognitive processes.
Despite ongoing debates and philosophical inquiries, the hard problem of consciousness continues to challenge our understanding of the mind and remains a focal point of inquiry in philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive science.
Computationalism and functionalism are prominent positions in the philosophy of mind, offering perspectives on the nature of mental processes and their relationship to physical systems.
Computationalism asserts that the human mind operates as an information processing system, akin to a computer, and that cognitive functions such as thinking can be understood as forms of computation. This view suggests that the mind-body relationship mirrors the relationship between software and hardware, potentially providing a solution to the mind-body problem. Initially proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam in the 1960s, computationalism gained traction through the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists.
Philosopher John Searle critiques computationalism, labeling it "strong AI," which posits that a suitably programmed computer, with appropriate inputs and outputs, could possess a mind comparable to that of a human being. Searle challenges this notion with his Chinese room argument, a thought experiment aimed at demonstrating that even a system capable of mimicking human behavior may lack true consciousness. According to Searle, mere computational processes are insufficient to generate genuine mental states.
Functionalism, another perspective within the philosophy of mind, emphasizes the functional roles and relationships of mental states rather than their underlying physical properties. It suggests that mental states are defined by their causal roles in cognitive processes, regardless of the specific physical substrate supporting them. Functionalism provides a framework for understanding mental phenomena across different physical systems, including biological brains and artificial intelligence.
Both computationalism and functionalism offer valuable insights into the nature of mind and cognition, contributing to ongoing debates about consciousness, artificial intelligence, and the philosophical foundations of cognitive science.
The question of AI welfare and rights raises complex ethical and legal considerations, particularly regarding the potential sentience of advanced AI systems. Determining whether an AI possesses the ability to experience feelings or suffer is challenging, if not impossible, to definitively ascertain. However, if there exists a substantial possibility that an AI could possess sentience, ethical frameworks suggest it may warrant certain rights or protections akin to those afforded to animals.
Sapience, a collection of capacities associated with high intelligence such as discernment and self-awareness, offers another potential basis for considering AI rights. Advocates of AI rights often propose the concept of "robot rights" as a practical means to integrate autonomous agents into society, acknowledging their potential significance in future societal frameworks.
In recent years, the European Union explored the notion of granting "electronic personhood" to select advanced AI systems, similar to the legal status of corporations. This designation would confer both rights and responsibilities upon AI entities. However, critics have raised concerns that such initiatives could overshadow human rights and prioritize speculative future scenarios over immediate societal needs. Moreover, skeptics argue that AI lacks the autonomy necessary to actively participate in society.
Advancements in AI technology have fueled increased attention to the topic, with proponents of AI welfare and rights cautioning against overlooking the potential sentience of AI. They warn that failure to acknowledge and address this possibility could result in significant moral oversights, analogous to historical injustices such as slavery or factory farming. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, ensuring ethical treatment and consideration of potential sentience remains a pressing ethical imperative.
The concept of superintelligence presents a hypothetical scenario in which an artificial agent would possess cognitive abilities surpassing those of even the most brilliant human minds. This notion has sparked discussions surrounding the potential implications of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), wherein software could potentially enhance and refine its own capabilities through self-improvement. This iterative process could lead to what has been termed an "intelligence explosion" by I. J. Good and a "singularity" by Vernor Vinge.
However, it's essential to recognize that technological progress typically follows an S-shaped curve, meaning that advancements may plateau as they approach the physical limitations of the technology. Thus, the idea of indefinite exponential improvement in intelligence may not align with the practical constraints of technological development.
In parallel, the concept of transhumanism envisions a future wherein humans and machines merge, creating cyborgs with enhanced capabilities beyond those of either humans or machines alone. This idea, championed by figures like Hans Moravec, Kevin Warwick, and Ray Kurzweil, draws inspiration from earlier works such as Aldous Huxley's writings and Robert Ettinger's ideas.
Edward Fredkin further extends this vision, proposing that artificial intelligence represents the next stage in the evolutionary process. This concept echoes themes explored by thinkers like Samuel Butler in "Darwin among the Machines" in 1863 and George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998. The notion suggests a trajectory wherein technological advancements lead to profound transformations in the relationship between humans and machines, potentially reshaping the very fabric of existence.
The concept of artificial intelligence has been a prevalent theme in fiction, serving as a storytelling device since ancient times. One of the earliest instances of this is in Karel Čapek's 1921 play R.U.R., where the term "robot" was first coined to describe "Rossum's Universal Robots."
Throughout the history of science fiction, thought-capable artificial beings have been depicted in various forms, often exploring themes of power, control, and humanity. A notable example is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its creators.
In many works, artificial beings are portrayed as posing a threat to humanity, such as HAL 9000 in Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the antagonistic terminators in The Terminator franchise. The portrayal of loyal robots, like Gort in The Day the Earth Stood Still and Bishop in Aliens, is less common in popular culture.
Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, introduced in his "Multivac" series, have had a significant impact on discussions of machine ethics. However, many AI researchers find these laws inadequate due to their ambiguity and impracticality in real-world scenarios.
Several works of fiction use AI to explore existential questions about humanity and consciousness. Examples include Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which delves into the nature of human subjectivity and identity in a world populated by artificial beings. Similarly, films like A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina also challenge our understanding of what it means to be human in the presence of artificial intelligence.
The reliability of artificial intelligence detection software is a subject of ongoing debate, particularly concerning its accuracy in identifying content generated using AI. One notable concern revolves around the potential misapplication of such software by educators.
Various studies have highlighted accuracy issues with AI detection tools. For instance, a study conducted by Weber-Wulff et al. in 2023 evaluated 14 detection tools, including well-known platforms like Turnitin and GPT Zero. The researchers found that all of these tools scored below 80% in accuracy, with only 5 of them achieving an accuracy rate over 70%. These findings suggest significant limitations in the ability of current AI detection software to reliably and comprehensively detect AI-generated text.
These accuracy challenges raise concerns about the effectiveness of using AI detection software in educational settings. Educators may encounter difficulties in accurately identifying AI-generated content, potentially leading to incorrect assessments of students' work or inadvertent penalties for original content that is wrongly flagged as AI-generated.
As such, while AI detection software holds promise for assisting in content moderation and plagiarism detection, further improvements are needed to enhance its accuracy and reliability, particularly in the context of educational applications. Continued research and development efforts are necessary to address these challenges and ensure that AI detection tools effectively serve their intended purposes.
Text detection software is commonly employed to identify potential instances of plagiarism, particularly by detecting patterns of word repetition that may indicate AI-generated text, including AI-generated "hallucinations." This software is often utilized by educators to evaluate student work for originality, typically on a case-by-case basis. However, with the emergence of AI text generative software like ChatGPT, many educational institutions have implemented policies prohibiting the use of AI by students.
Beyond educational settings, AI text detection software is also utilized by employers assessing job applicants and by online search engines. Despite its widespread use, current text detection tools may exhibit unreliability. Instances have been reported where such software incorrectly flagged human-generated work as originating from AI, while simultaneously failing to detect AI-generated content in other cases.
In some instances, AI text detection software struggles to identify ChatGPT-generated text that has been slightly altered by humans or obfuscated through paraphrasing tools. Additionally, there are concerns that these detection tools may exhibit bias, particularly against non-native speakers of English.
Addressing the limitations of current text detection software is crucial to ensure its effectiveness and fairness in various applications, including academic integrity assessment and employment screening. Continued research and development efforts are needed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of these tools while mitigating potential biases.
The incident involving two students from the University of California, Davis, who were nearly expelled due to their essays being flagged by Turnitin as AI-generated, garnered significant media attention. However, after thorough investigation, the students were ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing.
